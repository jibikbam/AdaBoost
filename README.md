# AdaBoost
AdaBoost using decision stumps (depth-1 decision tree) from SCRATCH

We use Decision Stumps as weak classifiers to create an AdaBoost classifier. Note that Decision Stumps are a depth-1 tree which contains minimal information. The code has
implementation of 4-fold cross validation and micro/macro F1 score calculation.

The goal of this code is the prediction of the white wine quality.
